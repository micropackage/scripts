## üß¨ About Scripts

This is a collection of scripts useful for (not only) WordPress development. Inspired by [@wordpress/scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts), this package contianis essential tools with default configuration.

## üíæ Installation

You only need to install one module:
``` bash
npm install @micropackage/scripts --save-dev
```
or
``` bash
yarn add -D @micropackage/scripts
```

## üïπ Usage

This package exposes a binary called `mp-scripts` which can be called directly with `npx` or `yarn`.
``` bash
npx mp-scripts build
yarn mp-scripts build
```
However it is intended to use this module in the `scripts` section in the `package.json` file of our project.

``` json
{
	"scripts": {
		"build": "mp-scripts build",
		"lint:js": "mp-scripts lint-js",
		"lint:style": "mp-scripts lint-style",
		"start": "mp-scripts start",
	}
}
```

## üìú Available Scripts

### `build`
Uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to transform your code. The default [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration scans entry directory and uses each file as an entry point. It is also possible to use css/scss files as entry points. Using [MiniCssExtractPlugin](https://github.com/[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) and a custom plugin for asset cleanup this will emit only css file for css/scss etry.
All the params passed to this script will be passed forward to [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). There are also params specific for this script:

| Parameter        | Default Value | Description                                                                                              |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **--entry-dir**  | 'src/assets'  | Directory in which to look for entries.                                                                  |
| **--output-dir** | 'dist'        | Output directory.<br/>_**Note:** this is not the same as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)'s `--output-path`. See examples below._ |
| **--js-dir**     | 'js'          | Scripts dir inside `--entry-dir`                                                                         |
| **--style-dir**  | 'scss'        | Style dir inside `--entry-dir`                                                                           |

*Example:*
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "mp-scripts build",
        "build:custom": "mp-scripts build entry-one.js entry-two.js --output-path=custom",
        "build:other": "mp-scripts build --entry-dir=other/src --output-dir=other/dist --js-dir=scripts --style-dir=styles"
    }
}
```
How to use it:
- `yarn build` - builds the code for production using entries from `src/assets/js` and `src/assets/scss`. Only files located directly in this folders will be used. All file names starting with `_` (underscore) are skipped. Output files will be placed inside `dist/js` and `dist/css` directories
- `yarn build:custom` - builds the code for production with two entry points and a custom output folder. Paths for custom entry points are relative to the project root.
- `yarn build:other` - this will work like the default build, but will look for entries inside `other/src/scripts` and `other/src/styles` directories. Output files will be placed inside `other/dist/scripts` and `other/dist/styles`.

### `lint-js`
Lints your code using [eslint](https://eslint.org/).
Default linting ruleset is [@wordpress/eslint-plugin/recommended](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/eslint-plugin). This can be overwriten by placing an [eslint](https://eslint.org/) config file in your project or specifing `eslintConfig` field in a `package.json`.

*Example:*
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "lint:js": "mp-scripts lint-js",
        "lint:js:src": "mp-scripts lint-js ./src"
    }
}
```

How to use it:
- `yarn lint:js` - lints JavaScript files in the entire project‚Äôs directories.
- `yarn lint:js:src` - lints JavaScript files in the project‚Äôs src subfolder‚Äôs directories.

By default, files located in `dist`, `vendor` and `node_modules` folders are ignored.

### `lint-style`
Uses [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to lint your style files.

*Example:*
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "lint:style": "mp-scripts lint-style",
        "lint:css:src": "mp-scripts lint-style 'src/**/*.css'"
    }
}
```
How to use it:
- `yarn lint:style` - lints CSS and SCSS files in the entire project‚Äôs directories.
- `yarn lint:css:src` - lints only CSS files in the project‚Äôs src subfolder‚Äôs directories.

By default, files located in `dist`, `vendor` and `node_modules` folders are ignored.

### `start`
This script works exactly like `build` but configured for development. It will also automatically rebuild if the code will change. All the params work the same as in `build` script.

*Example:*
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "start": "mp-scripts start",
        "start:custom": "mp-scripts start --entry-dir=custom/src --output-dir=custom/build"
    }
}
```

## üïµÔ∏è Advanced Usage

This package ships with default config files for [eslint](https://eslint.org/), [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Each config file can be overriden in your project.

### Extending [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) config

To extend default [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) config you can provide your own `webpack.config.js` file and `require` the provided `webpack.config.js` file. You can use spread operator to import parts of the config.

In the example below a webpack.config.js file is added to the root folder extending the provided [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) config to include [url-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/url-loader) for images:
```javascript
const defaultConfig = require( "@micropackage/scripts/config/[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).config" );

module.exports = {
	...defaultConfig,
	module: {
		...defaultConfig.module,
		rules: [
			...defaultConfig.module.rules,
			{
				test: /\.(png|jpg|gif)$/i,
				use: [
					{
						loader: 'url-loader',
						options: {
							limit: 8192,
							name: '[name].[ext]',
							outputPath: 'images',
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	},
};
```

## üì¶ About the Micropackage project

Micropackages - as the name suggests - are micro packages with a tiny bit of reusable code, helpful particularly in WordPress development.

The aim is to have multiple packages which can be put together to create something bigger by defining only the structure.

Micropackages are maintained by [BracketSpace](https://bracketspace.com).
